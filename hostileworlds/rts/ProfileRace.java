	//For info that defines the race of the team, helps setup stuff like
	//- Entity and Building appearance
	
	//For now we are basically having each team be the same building set and everything, 
	//so this class wont get used much for a while
	
	//for tech tree design, assume translation "barracks 1" -> "training post", "mech 1" -> "seige weapons"
	//so that tech trees can be the same structure between different races, but the actual buildings and units made are different
	//of course the races might differ enough to the point that you cant use similar tech trees, but still this should help for most of it if we break the tech tree creation up into modular pieces
